# Pitney Bowes Data Science Challenge

The objective of this data science challenge was to use data provided by Pitney Bowes to create a model that would predict which meters would fail within the next seven days. 

My group and I worked through this challenge from beginning to end, starting with a business and data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and ending with model deployment. The part of the project I worked most closely on was feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. I used imputation, numeric grouping, and scaling techniques and performed a principal component analysis and a linear discriminant analysis. We tested several models, including KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes, determining that our Naïve Bayes model fit the data best.
